I'm at the Chiefly library at ANU in Canberra. And I can't get internet access for my laptop. It's the same feeling I had in India - very frustrating!

I've been told that the campuswide free wireless network is only for staff and students and requires a login. I was also told I could go to the tiny computer shop and use the internet there (for $1 per ten minutes). They don't offer a comfortable environment conducive to thought (like I have here in the library). So while I sit amongst dozens of Macs and PCs that my taxes have contributed toward I am forbidden from accessing the net.

I think there's something wrong when such a hard line is drawn to define who can use public resources and who can't. I'm looking for a quiet place to work on my open source software. By allowing me Internet access the Uni would be increasing my productivity. My work is unpaid and for the public good but even if I was just improving my skills or providing services to people it's still increasing my output, my productivity.

For now, I'm going to work with the limitation - trying to adapt deprec to work with no Internet access. This should be an interesting exercise and I'l probably learn something. I would prefer a world where access to the Net was as easy to find as access to clean drinking water. This would allow a change to the way many of us live.
