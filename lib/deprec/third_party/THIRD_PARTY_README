Deprec was inspired by the brilliantly executed Capistrano. Thanks Jamis!

After starting on this project I found myself reading a lot of code by
Bradley Taylor, in particular the RailsMachine and VMbuilder gems.

Neil Wilson wrote three capistrano plugins that are used in this project.

I'd like to say a huge thanks to these guys for helping make my work easier!

For the first cut I have included all third party code in a directory within
the deprec gem, rather than link to the gems themselves. I made this decision 
to prevent deprec from breaking due to a change in one of the other libraries.
