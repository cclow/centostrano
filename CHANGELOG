== 1.99.5 (Feb 12, 2008)

* feature: installs and configures monit to manage your mongrel processes [Mike Bailey]

* feature: When running config_gen,  if deprec discovers a file exists, checks 
           whether the new file differs from the existing one. If they're 
           identical, it skips it.

		   If they differ, the user is presented with the options to overwrite 
		   or not but now there's an extra option to view a diff of the changes 
		   that would occur. [Mike Bailey]

* change:  handle_command_with_input now accepts an optional response parameter.
           This is useful if you need to change a password on many servers and 
           don't want to have to keep entering the password at the prompt for
           each box. [Mike Bailey]

== 1.99.4 (Feb 11, 2008)

* Bugfix: set correct path to templates [Mike Bailey]
